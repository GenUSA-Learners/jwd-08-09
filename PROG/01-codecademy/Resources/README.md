# Codecademy Resources

Generation uses Codecademy as a major learning platform to help with understanding how each piece of the coding puzzle fits together. Your instructional staff will demonstrate critical concepts in class, but there are so many tiny details when learning to code that they cannot all possibly be covered during classtime.

And that's where the benefits of using Codecademy come into play. This platform does an amazing job of teaching you exactly where everything connects. ***Codecademy*** (and of course, [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)) is the first place you will look if you have questions about how the code works, and from now on, it's your **main priority** (..until we get to *personal projects* and *portfolios* :wink:). It's a necessary piece of the program content, and required to help you learn everything you need to learn to become a good developer.

We've included some resources that Codecademy provides below. This is a perfect place to start when looking for **more information on** `technical information`, `extra projects`, `cheatsheets`, `articles`, `videos`, etc.
